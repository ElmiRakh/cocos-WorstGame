# cocos-WorstGame
It's a 2 player game made with python cocos2d and PodSixNet. It is undone and has examples of worst coding practicies, yet works in relative degree. Architecture is quite basic - gamestate is on the server updates without relying on user and clients just request a updated state. It might have some educational value, in the sense of - "You shouldn't EVER code like THIS".
